💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression
Fraudulent transactions are a critical challenge in the financial sector. This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using a logistic regression model trained on a highly imbalanced dataset of over 6.3 million transactions.

📁 Dataset Information
Rows: ~6.3 million

Columns: 10

Due to large size, the dataset is not uploaded to this repo.

📊 Features
Feature Name	Description
step	Time step of the transaction
type	Type of transaction (e.g., CASH_OUT, TRANSFER)
amount	Transaction amount
oldbalanceOrg	Sender’s original balance
newbalanceOrig	Sender’s balance after transaction
oldbalanceDest	Receiver’s original balance
newbalanceDest	Receiver’s balance after transaction
isFraud	Target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Not Fraud)
isFlaggedFraud	System flag (always 0 here, dropped during preprocessing)

🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dataset is highly imbalanced — most transactions are genuine.

Fraud is concentrated in CASH_OUT and TRANSFER transaction types.

Extreme values found in multiple columns like amount, oldbalanceOrg — handled using log1p transformation.

Heatmap revealed strong correlation between oldbalanceDest and newbalanceDest.

🛠️ Data Preprocessing
Log Transformation on skewed columns to reduce outlier impact:

amount, oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig, oldbalanceDest, newbalanceDest

One-Hot Encoding for type (categorical, non-ordinal).

Dropped isFlaggedFraud as it held no meaningful variance.

Class imbalance handled using class_weight='balanced' in model training.

🤖 Model: Logistic Regression
Chosen for its simplicity and explainability.

Used class_weight='balanced' to deal with data imbalance.

Trained on preprocessed data with transformed numerical features.

📈 Model Performance

🧮 Confusion Matrix:
                         Predicted: Not Fraud     Predicted: Fraud
Actual: Not Fraud            1,821,544               84,805
Actual: Fraud                      18                2,419

🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fraud-Detection-Project.git
cd Fraud-Detection-Project

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add the dataset to the jupyter folder (name it Fraud.csv)

4. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook Fraud_Detection.ipynb

 
🔮 Future Improvements
Try ensemble models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM

Use SMOTE or under-sampling for better class balance

Integrate real-time fraud detection pipeline (e.g., Kafka + Flask)

Perform threshold tuning for better precision-recall trade-off
